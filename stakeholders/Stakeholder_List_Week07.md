# Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholders are classified into the four quadrants of the Power-Interest Matrix as follows:

### Power–Interest Matrix

| Power \ Interest | Low Interest | High Interest |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Power** | **High Power / Low Interest**<br>*(Keep Satisfied)*<br>• N/A (None currently identified) | **High Power / High Interest**<br>*(Manage Closely)*<br>• Project Sponsor |
| **Low Power** | **Low Power / Low Interest**<br>*(Monitor)*<br>• Dataset Provider | **Low Power / High Interest**<br>*(Keep Informed)*<br>• Project Team Members<br>• End Users |

## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### 1. High Power / High Interest (Manage Closely)
* **Stakeholders:** Project Sponsor
* **Strategy:** This is the key decision-maker. We must fully engage them and make the greatest effort to satisfy their requirements.
* **Action:** Schedule regular progress updates and seek immediate feedback on approval of key milestones.

### 2. High Power / Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
* **Stakeholders:** N/A
* **Strategy:** Put in enough work to keep them satisfied, but do not bore them with excessive communication.
* **Action:** Monitor for any new stakeholders entering this category (e.g., regulatory bodies).

### 3. Low Power / High Interest (Keep Informed)
* **Stakeholders:** Project Team Members, End Users
* **Strategy:** Adequately inform these people to ensure no major issues are arising. They are deeply involved in the details but lack high-level authority.
* **Action:**
    * **Team:** Maintain smooth collaboration through clear task assignments.
    * **End Users:** Ensure accurate classification and usability through testing feedback.

### 4. Low Power / Low Interest (Monitor)
* **Stakeholders:** Dataset Provider
* **Strategy:** Monitor these stakeholders, but do not bore them with excessive communication.
* **Action:** Ensure proper data usage and acknowledgment in the system documentation.
