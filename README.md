#  AI Project Management – News Topic Classification
## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete project management documentation  for the News Topic Classification system, developed as part of the BAXI3533 AI Project Management course.

The project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automatically classifies news articles into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system targets a minimum accuracy of 85% while optimizing for efficiency and usability.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop an AI Classification Model: Create a machine learning/deep learning model capable of classifying news articles into predefined categories with ≥85% accuracy.
2. Reduce Manual Effort: Minimize time and effort required for manual news sorting and tagging.
3. Improve Information Retrieval: Enhance user experience through better content discovery and personalized recommendations.
4. Build a Scalable System: Ensure the solution is efficient and suitable for real-time classification.

## Key Deliverables
- Trained classification model with performance evaluation metrics
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline
- Classification API/user interface for real-time predictions
- Comprehensive project documentation and final report
- Deployment guide and integration instructions
