# Corrective Actions – Week 08

## Corrective Action 1: Focused Scope Refinement
To address delays in text preprocessing and feature extraction, the project will focus only on the most effective techniques identified during earlier experiments. For example, we can limit feature extraction to TF-IDF and selected n-gram ranges. This reduces unnecessary experimentation and helps bring the tasks back on schedule.

## Corrective Action 2: Optimized Resource and Schedule Allocation
Model training using GPU resources will be conducted in planned sessions only, with hyperparameter tuning limited to critical parameters. Also, the documentation work will continue in parallel with model training to ensure overall progress is maintained without increasing project cost.
