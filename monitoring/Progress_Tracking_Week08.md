## Performance Analysis

### 1. Which tasks show the largest deviation from plan?
Text Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Model Training (GPU) show the largest deviations from the planned progress. These tasks are behind schedule by 10–15% compared to the planned completion.

### 2. What are the possible causes?
The delays are mainly caused by the complexity of text data preprocessing, including handling noisy data and class imbalance. Additional time was also required to experiment with different feature extraction techniques and to fine-tune model parameters during training.

### 3. Are the issues related to scope, cost, resources, or risks identified earlier?
The issues are primarily related to resource and risk factors. Data quality challenges and model performance risks identified earlier have impacted the progress of AI-related tasks, particularly those that require iterative experimentation and GPU resources.
