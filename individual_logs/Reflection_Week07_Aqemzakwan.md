# Reflection Week 07 - Aqem Zakwan

### 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
n my opinion, effective communication helps us find problems early. When we talk clearly to the team and stakeholders, we avoid misunderstandings about the requirements. This reduces the risk of making mistakes or finishing late.

### 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
In my opinion, the Project Supervisor is the most critical stakeholder. They have high power because they guide the project direction and evaluate the final result. If I do not manage their expectations well, my project might not be accepted.
