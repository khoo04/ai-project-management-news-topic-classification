## 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The Model Development phase has the highest cost because it involves intensive human resources for algorithm implementation, debugging, and data experiments, as well as GPU usage for model training, which incurs additional hourly costs.

## 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?

Costs can be reduced by:
- Using free or open-source software alternatives.
- Reusing existing frameworks or datasets to save preparation and training time.
- Sharing workload efficiently so team members handle complementary tasks, reducing redundant efforts.

## 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?

Proper resource allocation ensures that each team member focuses on their area of expertise, which increases efficiency and reduces delays. Then, the computational resources, such as GPUs, are allocated at the right time, which avoids bottlenecks and helps the project stay within both budget and timeline.
