# Week 07 Reflection – Communication & Stakeholder Management

1. **How does effective communication reduce project risks?**  
Effective communication reduces project risks by ensuring everyone understands the project goals, progress, and issues. Regular updates help identify problems early and prevent misunderstandings that could delay the project.

2. **Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?**  
The Product Owner is the most critical stakeholder because they define the project requirements and ensure the news topic classification system meets business needs. Their decisions directly affect the system’s usefulness and success.
