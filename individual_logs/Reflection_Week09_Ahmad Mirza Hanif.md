# Reflection Week 09 - AHMAD MIRZA SHAHMI BIN ABDUL HANIF

### 1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?
Identifying the critical path is important because it determines the minimum project duration and highlights activities that directly affect the completion date.

### 2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?
The activity on the critical path with the longest duration posed the highest scheduling risk, as any delay in it delays the entire project.

### 3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?
Crashing a project involves trading increased costs and resource strain for a shorter project duration.
