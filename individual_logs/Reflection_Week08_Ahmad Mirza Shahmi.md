# Lessons Learned – Week 08

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The Work Breakdown Structure, rather than serving as a passive checklist, ruthlessly exposed the fragility of our timeline by stripping away the comforting delusion that we had infinite time to refine the code.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
I would, instead of insulating the development process from external noise, force a collision with end-users immediately, since building in a vacuum simply guarantees we solve the wrong problem with immaculate precision.
