# Reflection Week 06 - KHOO ZHEN XIAN

## 1. Which quality criterion will be hardest to achieve?

The most challenging quality criterion for this project will be achieving consistently high model accuracy across all topic categories.
Different news topics such as politics, sports, business, entertainment often have overlapping vocabulary, inconsistent writing styles, and varying dataset sizes. Hence, the model might perform well on certain classes but struggle with others.

## 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?

The risk that poses the greatest threat is dataset quality and imbalance.
If the dataset contains noisy articles, duplicated content, misinformation, or uneven representation of topics, the model may learn biased patterns and produce unreliable predictions.

## 3. How does quality management support project success?
- Setting accuracy and performance benchmarks, so the model is evaluated objectively.
- Ensuring data quality, which strengthens the reliability and fairness of the classification results.
- Identifying risks early, allowing the team to implement mitigation strategies before issues escalate.

## 4. Add screenshots of MS Teams announcements in Part A.
