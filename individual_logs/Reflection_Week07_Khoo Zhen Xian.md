# Reflection Week 07 - KHOO ZHEN XIAN

### 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
I think effective communication helps us to ensure that all stakeholders clearly understand the project objectives, progress, and potential issues. By providing regular updates and feedback, misunderstandings can be identified early, technical problems can be addressed faster, and project scope creep can be avoided.

### 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
The project supervisor is the most critical stakeholder because they provide guidance, feedback, and approval throughout the project. Their insights help ensure that the project meets all requirements, stays on track, and achieves its intended goals.
