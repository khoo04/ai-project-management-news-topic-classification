# Reflection Week 05

## 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The phase the has the highest cost is building the prototype interface that cost us RM300. This phase require a lot of attention to details to make sure the project
not have any issue in the future

## 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
1. Use open-source tools and frameworks instead of paid software for design and development.
2. Reuse existing templates or components from previous projects to save time and resources.
3. Implement efficient project management by setting clear priorities and deadlines to minimize rework.

## 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Good resource allocation helps us finish our work on time and stay organized. When everyone knows what they need to do and we manage our time and budget well, 
the project runs smoothly. If resources are not managed properly, it can cause delays and affect the success of the project.
