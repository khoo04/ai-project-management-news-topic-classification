## 1.	Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?
Identifying the critical path is important because it shows which tasks affect the project’s finish date. This helps project managers know which tasks to focus on and avoid delays.

## 2.	Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?
Model Training (H) is the riskiest because it can take a long time and delays here will affect all the tasks after it.

## 3.	What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?
Crashing a project can make it finish faster, but it usually costs more, can lower quality, and may stress resources or workers.
