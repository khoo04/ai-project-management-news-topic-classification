# Reflection Week 04 - FARIZ DANISH BIN FADLI

## 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The Model Development and System Integration

## 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?

Breaking down the tasks helps us to save time by allowing us to focus on one step at a time and avoid confusion.

## 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?

I would adjust the schedule by spreading out the workload more evenly throughout the week to avoid rushing near the deadline.
