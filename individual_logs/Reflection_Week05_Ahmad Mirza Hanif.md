# Reflection Week 05 - AHMAD MIRZA SHAHMI BIN ABDUL HANIF

## 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The phase the has the highest cost is building the prototype interface. This phase requires a lot of attention due to its nature of "Fail to plan, plan to fail", or
if it were to be rephrased, "Fail to build, build to fail."

## 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?

In this digital era, there are a lot of ways to reduce cost:
i. Remove unnecessary features or scope from the project (negotiate with customer).
ii. Use free open source softwares.
iii. Pirate or buy someone's license at a lower cost. (Not recommended, but worth the cost)

## 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?

Having resource allocation can prevent the schedule become too cluttered with complex tasks, reducing unnecessary cost or payment made
just have a task achieved. Allocating them will help team to see what can be deemed as cost effective.
