# Reflection Week 06 – News Topic Classification Project

## 1. Hardest Quality Criterion
The hardest criterion to achieve is maintaining high and consistent accuracy across all news categories because some topics overlap in vocabulary, making them difficult to classify correctly.

## 2. Greatest Project Risk
The biggest risk is class imbalance in the dataset, as it can cause the model to favour certain categories and reduce accuracy for minority classes.

## 3. How Quality Management Helps
Quality management ensures the dataset, model, and UI meet clear standards. This reduces errors, prevents rework, and improves the reliability of the final system.
