# Lessons Learned – Week 08

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
Setting clear milestones and breaking tasks into smaller parts helped us keep track of our progress. It made it easier to see what was done and what still needed more time.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
For future projects, I would check the data more carefully at the beginning. This would help avoid problems later during data cleaning and feature engineering.
