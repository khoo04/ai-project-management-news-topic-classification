# Reflection Week 08 - KHOO ZHEN XIAN

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
I think defining clear milestones and task-level completion percentages helped us to track the project progress effectively and identify delays early.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
In future projects, I would conduct a deeper data quality assessment earlier to reduce delays during preprocessing and feature engineering stages.
