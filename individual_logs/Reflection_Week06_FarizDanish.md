# Reflection Week 06
##1.	Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?
The hardest quality criterion to achieve is reaching the target model accuracy.
This is because our dataset, model tuning, and time limitations may affect how well the model performs, so achieving a high accuracy consistently can be challenging.

#2.	Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The biggest threat is the model not reaching the required accuracy.
If the accuracy is too low, the whole AI system may not work as expected, and this can delay the project because we will need more time to improve or retrain the model.

#3.	How does quality management support project success?
Quality management helps make sure the project stays on track.
It sets clear standards, reduces mistakes, improves team coordination, and ensures our final deliverables meet expectations. Overall, it increases the chances of a successful project outcome.

#4.	Add screenshots of MS Teams announcements in Part A.
