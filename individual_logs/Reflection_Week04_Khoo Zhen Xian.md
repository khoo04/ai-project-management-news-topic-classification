# Reflection Week 04 - KHOO ZHEN XIAN

## 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The Model Development and Data Collection & Preparation phases had the most subtasks, with a total of three subtasks each.

## 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?

Breaking the project into smaller tasks made it much easier to assign responsibilities to each team member.
It also helped us set timeline and track progress of project more effectively, since we could monitor specific deliverables rather than broad, vague goals.

## 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?

Next week, we plan to review the timeline for the Data Collection & Preparation phase, as it overlaps slightly with the early stage of Model Development.
Also, we will review task dependencies to ensure that no phase starts before its required deliverables are ready.
