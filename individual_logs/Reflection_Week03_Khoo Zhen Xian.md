# Reflection Week 03 - KHOO ZHEN XIAN

## 1. What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?

The most challenging part of building the schedule was deciding the appropriate duration for each task to ensure all activities could be completed on time. 

## 2. How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?

GitHub supported collaboration by providing version control, allowing the team to track changes and maintain an organized project history. Microsoft Teams served as a communication platform where members could share updates, discuss ideas, and coordinate tasks efficiently.

## 3. What tasks will you refine next week?

Next week, I will refine the data collection and preparation tasks, including reviewing dataset options and improving the data preprocessing workflow. I will also help adjust the schedule if any tasks require more accurate time estimates.
