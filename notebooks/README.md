# Notebooks Directory

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, experimentation, and analysis.

## Purpose
- Test and visualize algorithms
- Document step-by-step model development

## Notes
- Each notebook should be clearly named (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_model_training.ipynb`)
- Keep notebooks lightweight and well-documented for reproducibility.
