## Project Scope
The scope defines the boundaries and key components of the project.

### In Scope
The project will encompass the following activities:  
i.	Data Acquisition:  
    Gathering a labeled dataset of news articles from public repositories.  
ii.	Data Preprocessing:  
    Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization/ stemming.  
iii.Feature Extraction:  
    Converting text into numerical features using methods such as TF-IDF or word embedding (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).  
iv.	Model Development:  
    Training and tuning machine learning/ deep learning algorithms as described in the proposed approach (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Transformer-based models).  
v.	Model Evaluation:  
    Rigorous assessment of model performance using defined evaluation metrics.  

### Out of Scope
The following items are explicitly excluded from this project’s scope:
i.	Development of a large-scale, real-time news scraping system.
ii.	Classification based on multimedia content (images, videos).
iii.Deployment of a commercial-grade, public-facing web application.
iv.	Classification for languages other than English.


## Project Objectives
The project aims to achieve the following specific goals:
1.	To develop an AI model that can automatically classify news articles into predefined categories with a minimum accuracy of 85%.
2.	To reduce the time and effort required for manual news sorting and tagging.
3.	To improve information retrieval and recommendation for users.
