## Project Scope
The scope defines the boundaries and key components of the project.

### In Scope
The project will encompass the following activities:  
- Data Acquisition: Gathering a labeled dataset of news articles from public repositories.
   
- Data Preprocessing: Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization/ stemming.
  
- Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical features using methods such as TF-IDF or word embedding (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).  

- Model Development: Training and tuning machine learning/ deep learning algorithms as described in the proposed approach (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Transformer-based models).  

- Model Evaluation: Rigorous assessment of model performance using defined evaluation metrics.  

### Out of Scope
The following items are explicitly excluded from this project’s scope:
- Development of a large-scale, real-time news scraping system.
- Classification based on multimedia content (images, videos).
- Deployment of a commercial-grade, public-facing web application.
- Classification for languages other than English.


## Project Objectives
The project aims to achieve the following specific goals:
1.	To develop an AI model that can automatically classify news articles into predefined categories with a minimum accuracy of 85%.
2.	To reduce the time and effort required for manual news sorting and tagging.
3.	To improve information retrieval and recommendation for users.

## Project Deliverables
The AI-powered news classification system will produce several key deliverables that collectively form a complete, production-ready solution. These deliverables include technical components such as trained models and preprocessing pipelines, as well as documentation and interfaces necessary for successful deployment and ongoing maintenance. Each deliverable is designed to ensure the system meets performance requirements, remains scalable, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing content management workflows. 
Trained Classification Model: A fully trained and optimized machine learning/deep learning model capable of classifying news articles into predefined categories with minimum 85% accuracy. 

- Preprocessing Pipeline: A complete text preprocessing module including tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and text cleaning functions ready for production use. 

- Feature Extraction Module: Implementation of feature engineering techniques (TF-IDF, word embeddings, or BERT) for converting raw text into model-ready format. 

- Model Performance Report: Comprehensive evaluation document containing accuracy metrics, precision, recall, F1-scores, and confusion matrix analysis for all tested models. 

- Source Code and Documentation: Well-documented codebase with clear instructions for model training, testing, and deployment, including requirements and setup guides. 

- Classification API/Interface: A functional application programming interface (API) or user interface for real-time article classification and batch processing. 

- Deployment Guide: Technical documentation outlining deployment procedures, system requirements, and integration guidelines for production environments. 

- Test Dataset and Results: Annotated test dataset with classification results demonstrating model performance on unseen data.
