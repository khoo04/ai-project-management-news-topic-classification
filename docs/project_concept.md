## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s digital era, the volume of online news is growing rapidly, making it challenging for users and organizations to manually categorize and filter content. Without effective classification, readers struggle to find relevant information, and media platforms face difficulties in managing large volumes of unstructured text. An AI-powered news classification system can automatically categorize articles (e.g., politics, sports, technology, health), improving content organization and user experience.

## Objectives
- Automatically classify news articles into predefined categories with high accuracy.
- Reduce the time and effort required for manual news sorting and tagging.
- Improve information retrieval and recommendation for users.
- Develop a scalable and efficient AI model suitable for real-time classification.

## Proposed Approach
The project will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning/deep learning techniques. The process includes text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization), feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or BERT), and model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).

## Expected Outcome
An AI model that can classify news articles into relevant categories with at least 85% accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for classification performance.
- Confusion matrix to assess misclassification between categories.
